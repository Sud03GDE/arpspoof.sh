This is a simple bash script for ARP spoofing.

DISCLAIMER: I MADE THIS SCRIPT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES! DON'T USE IT FOR THE WRONG REASONS! 

Running The Script

1) Make sure you are using a Linux system. I don't know if this script would work on WSL. 
2) Have these packages installed: dsniff, sslstrip and termdown for the countdown timer.
3) If you don't have them installed: sudo apt install dsniff sslstrip, 
  pip3 install termdown.
4) Now download the script from github: git clone https://github.com/Sud03GDE/arpspoofscript
5) go into the directory: cd arpspoofscript
6) Install the requirements(termdown) if you haven't already: pip3 install requirements.txt
7) Give the script perms to run: chmod +x arpspoof.sh
8) Now for actually using the script: ./arpspoof.sh
9) CRTL-C when you're done using it.

I hope you enjoy the script!
